## Epidemiological Study Designs

## Learning outcomes


## Case series
- A number of cases closely studied
- No comparison group
- Used for surveillance
- Study design used for hypothesis generation
- Cannot be used for causal inference

## Measures we can obtain from case series
- Prevalence of outcome
  - Number of people with outcome / Total number of people
- Incidence of outcome
  - Numbe of new outcomes / Person-time

## Example of Case series

## Cross-sectional survey
- Survey of all people all at the same time
- Information on exposure and
- Information on outcome obtained at the same time
- Relatively inexpensive in terms of time and funds
- Low degree of causal information 

## Measures obtained from cross-sectional survey
- Prevalence of an outcome
- Prevalence Odds Ratio
  - Prevalence among those with the condition
  - Prevalence among those without the condition
  - Comparison between the two
- Example
  - 1000 people surveyed for high blood pressure in a city X
  - 50 people were identified with high blood pressure
  - What is the prevalence of high blood pressure in city X?

## Example of cross-sectional survey

## Case control study
- Comparative study where sampling is based on outcomes
- Cases are those with the outcome
- Controls are practically same as cases except they do not have the outcome
- Cases and controls are examined for exposure

## Effect measure of case contol study - 1
- Among those **with** the outcome:
  - A numbe of people had the exposure
  - C number of people did not have the exposure
  - Odds of exposure given **case status**: A / C

## Among those **without** the outcome: 
- B nubmer of people had the exposure
- D number of people did not have the exposure
- Odds of exposure given **control status**: B / D

## Hence, effect measure of case control study
- Ratio of Odds of exposure
- Odds of exposure for cases: (A / C) 
- Odds of exposure for controls: (B / D) 
- Odds Ratio = A * D / B  * C  

## When is Case control study indicated
- When the outcome is a rare outcome
- Rare outcome: an outcome with prevalence <= 1/10, 000
- Example of rare outcome: studies that investigate causes of cancer
- Perhaps the best and most economical observational study design
- Odds Ratio = Relative Risk estimate in prospective studies
- Many exposures can be studied together

## Shortfall of case control studies
- Risk of selection bias
- Risk of response bias
- Cannot ascertain whether exposure definitely preceded outcome
- Overmatching is a problem

## Example of a case control study:
- TK

## Cohort study
- Comparative study design where sampling is based on exposure
- This study design can be prospective or retrospective
- Individuals are classified on the basis of their exposure
- Exposed and non-exposed
- All individuals are followed up over time

## Effect measure of cohort studies
- Concept of person-time
  - 1 person followed for 1 year = 1 person-year
  - 10 people followed for 1 year = 10 person-year
  - Same as 1 person followed for 10 years
- Rate of outcome among the exposed
- Rate of outcome among the non-exposed
- Rate Ratio among exposed vs non-exposed

## Prospective versus Retrospective cohort study
- Prospective cohort study:
  - Exposure now, outcome occurs in future
- Retrospective cohort study
  - Exposure in the past, outcome occurs in past/present
  - Commonly used in studies of occupational hazards

## Indication of cohort studies
- Ideal observational study design for causal linkage
- Very expensive in terms of time and money
- Not ideal for those outcomes that take a long time to emerge
- Not ideal for rare diseases
- Ideal for common diseases
- Many outcomes can be studied for a common exposure

## Example of a cohort study 

## Randomised controlled trials
- Concept of randomisation
- What happens in Randomised controlled trials
- Exposure or Intervention and Control
- Prospective study

## Effect measure of RCT
- Rate of outcome in the intervention group
- Rate of outcome in the control group
- Rate Ratio is the ratio of intervention and controls

## Advantages of RCT
- It is the best study design to meet causal criteria
- Blinded RCT (Allocation concealment)
  - Single blind RCT
  - Double blind RCT
- Controls for known and unknown confounding variables
- Mostly controls for selection bias

## Intention to treat analysis
  - Once randomised always analysed
  - Regardless how individuals move between treatment and control arms:
  - They are analysed in the order they were originally allocated
  - This procedure minimises selection bias
  
## Crossover RCTs

## RCTs and limited generalisability

## Example of an RCT

## Relationship between study design and causal information

## Hierarchy of evidence as per study designs
