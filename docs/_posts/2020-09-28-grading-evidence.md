# How to grade evidence using GRADEPRO GDT

## Learning outcomes

## How to grade quality of evidence

## Focus on outcomes

## One outcome many studies

## One study many outcomes

## Go by outcomes
- Select an outcome
- Identify interventions relevant to that outcome
- Group studies based on a single intervention-outcome combination for a particular patient profile
- Identify comparators for the intervention-outcome combination
- Critically appraise the entire body of evidence
- Arrive at a summary score

## GRADE approach

## Grading outcomes with GRADE: step by step
- Step 0: Log in to GRADEpro GDT
- Step 1: Frame the question
- Step 2: Add outcome one by one
- Step 3: Identify groups of studies together
- Step 4: Read and mark the relevant sections in the methods and results section of the papers
- Step 5: Transfer from paper or word processor or notebook to GRADEpro GDT

## Demonstration and Live Coding with the distributed paper
- Step 0: Log in
- Step 1: Frame the question directly in GRADEpro GDT
- Step 2: Add outcome one by one (refer to the PDF distributed before hand)
- Step 3: Identify the groups of studies (done for you)
- Step 4: Transfer the relevant sections from PDF to GDT

## Hands-on: Work on your own in groups with the five studies provided to you using Gradepro GDT

## Discussion points: what did you learn?

## Summary and Conclusion
