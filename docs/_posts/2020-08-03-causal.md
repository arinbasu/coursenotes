# Causal Inference

## Learning objectives
- Define causal inference from association
- Identify Hill's Criteria
- Estimate AR% and PAR%
- identify component cause model
- Identify sufficient causes
- Define counterfactual causation

## Correlation does not imply causation

## How do we go from association to causation?
- Association must be internally valid
- Nature of Association must support causal criteria

## Recap of Internal Validity
- Rule out chance
- Eliminate bias
- Control for confounding

## Causal criteria
- Hill's consideration
- Rothman's Wheels of component causes
- DAGs and SWIGs

## Sir Austin Bradford Hill, 1965
- Talked of nine criteria
- These are considerations rather than as criteria

## Bradford-Hill Criteria

## Attributable Risk, Relative Risk and NNT
- Attributable Risk
- Relative Risk
- Numbers needed to treat

## Description of a study

## Attributable Risk or Absolute Risk
- Rate among the exposed
- Rate among the non-exposed
- Difference in the two rates
- Numbers needed to treat or harm

## Absolute risk varies with the prevalence of the outcome

## Relative Risk
- Rate among the exposed
- Rate among the non-exposed
- Relative Risk

## Hands-on exercise with the provided study
- Find out the absolute Risk
- find out the relative risk
- which risk estimate will you use for this study and why?

## Population Attributable Risk and PAR%

## Hands-on exercise with the provided study

## Ken Rothman's component cause model

## Sufficient causes

## Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) for causal model
- Sewall Wright's path tracing rules
- Directed acyclic graphs
- L,A,Y,U terminology of causal path diagrams
- Backdoor and frontdoor criteria
- Open and closed paths
- Collider bias

## Sewall Wright's path tracing rules
- Paths can start from any point X
- Once started in one direction, must continue in the same direction
- Only one curved arrow allowed in a path
- Path cannot traverse the same variable twice

## Example of a valid path

## L-A-Y-U causal path tracing
- Block all backdoor paths
- Blocking can be done by controlling on a variable
  - Stratification
  - Matching
  - Multivariable adjustment
- Colliders
- Controlling on colliders open a closed path
- Controlling on a mediator or confounder closes an open backdoor path

## Example of confounding variable on LAY path

## Example of selection bias on LAY path

## Hands-on exercise of drawing a causal path
