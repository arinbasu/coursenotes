# Epidemiology

## Learning objectives

## Definition of Epidemiology
> Distribution and determinants of health states in populations and use of that information to promote health and prevent illnesses

## Measures of Epidemiology
- Measures of distribution
- Measures of determinants
- Study designs to get the measures
- Applications of these measures

## Measures of distribution
- Proportions and rates
- Prevalence
- Incidence
- Standardisation

## Proportions and Rates
- Imagine a town of 400 people
- 40 people have a disease D
- proportion of people with the disease?

## Rates of disease
- Imageine a town T of 400 people
- 40 people developed D in year 1
- 20 more people developed D in year 2
- What is the rate of disease progression?
- Rate is like speed, how fast

## Prevalence of Disease
- Imagine a town T of 400 people
- 40 people have the disease D
- Prevalence of D: 40 / 400
- Prevalence is proportion

## Demonstration of Age-specific prevalence
- In Town T, 400 people 
- Diffrent Age groups
- Prevalence of disease in each age group
- Age-specific prevalence

## Hands-on age specific prevalence
- Refer to the spreadsheet provided
- Calculate age-specific prevalence for each age group
- Discuss in the class

## Graphing Age-specific prevalence
- Take the age-specific prevalence
- Graph the prevalence against Age group
- What pattern do we see?
- What does it tell us?

## Another town X 
- Different population composition
- Diffrent age-specific rates
- What do the graphs of Town X and Town T suggest?
- How do we resolve the differences?

## Concept of standard population
- SEGI world population

## Demo: how to use standardised population
- For Town T, take the age-specific rates, then
- Apply to each age band of SEGI population, then
- Multiply age-specific rates with age-specific population, this
- gives us the number of people with illness in the age-specific groups
- sum them up, this
- gives us the total number of people in the standardised population and 
- Age-standardised prevalence

## Your turn: work with me:
- Apply the same principles and calculate the age-standardised prevalence for Town X

## Compare Town T and Town X
- Which town has higher prevalence?

## Discussion: how can you use this technique for environmental health?

## Incidence
- Incidence is the rate of new cases in susceptible people at risk
- Concept of person-time
  - 1 person followed for 1 year = 1 person-year
  - 100 people followed for 1 year = 100 person-year
  - Same as 1 person followed for 100 years = 100 person-year
- Incidence = number of new cases / person-years

## Worked out example of Incidence

## Age-standardised incidence 

## Concept of standardised mortality and morbidity ratio

## Study designs in epidemiology for prevalence 
- Case studies and case series
- Cross-sectional surveys

## Case series
- Surveillance
## Cross-sectional surveys
- Many people surveyed at the same time
- Prevalence

## Example of a cross-sectional survey

## Measurement of incidence
- Prospective cohort study
- People who are exposed and non-exposed
- Studied over a period of time
- Counted how many people develop outcomes
- Survival curves are useful

## Example of prospective cohort study

## Kaplan Meier Survival curve to show how to estimate incidence

## Measurement of determinants of diseases
- Standardised mortality and morbidity ratio
- Rate Ratio and relative risk estimates
- Odds Ratio

## Standardised mortality ratio
- Hands-on exercise to calculate standardised rates
- Compare the two standardised rates to calculate standardised mortality ratio

## Relative Risk and rate ratio
- Rate of disease or outcomes among the exposed (E)
- Rate of disease or outcomes among the non-exposed (NE)
- Rate Ratio = E / NE

## How to use rate ratio and relative risk estimates
- Population attributable risk
- PAR%
- Hands-on calculation of PAR and PAR% from studies

## Work with me: calculate PAR and PAR% from actual study

## Epidemiological study designs that help to calculate these measures
- Prospective cohort study
- Retrospective Cohort study

## Retrospective Cohort study
- Exposure and Outcome BOTH occurred in the past, or
- Exposure occurred in the past, and outcome occurs in present
- In each case participants are followed up in real time
- Use Kaplan Meier Survival curves to estimate the rate ratios
- Popular study designs in Occupational health

## Demonstration of a study in Occupational Health that is retrospective cohort study

## Measure of association: Odds Ratio

## Odds of Exposure if you have the disease
- Imagine a study where we are studying 100 people with lung cancer:
  - 60 of them are exposed to secondhand smoke (A)
  - 40 of them are NOT exposed to secondhand smoke (B)
  - Odds of exposure to secondhand smoke among those who have lung cancer: 60:40
  
## Odds of Exposure if you do not have the disease  
- Now imagine another group of 100 other people with NO lung cancer
  - 30 of them are exposed to secondhand smoke (C)
  - 70 of them are NOT exposed to secondhand smoke (D)
  - Odds of exposure to secondhand smoke among those WITHOUT disease: 30:70
  
## Odds Ratio = Ratio of the two odds
- Measure of association
- Used in cross-sectional surveys as prevalence odds ratio
- Used in case-control studies as odds ratio
- Odds Ratio = Relative Risk or Rate Ratio for all intents and purposes

## Illustration of Odds Ratio in a real world study

## Case control study design
- Concepts of cases
- Concepts of controls
- Controls are same as cases except that they do not have disease

## Example of a case control study
