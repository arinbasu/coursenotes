## Internal and External Validity

## Learning objectives

## Chance, Bias, Confounding
- Rule out chance
- Eliminate Bias
- Control for confounding

## Ruling out chance factor

## p-value and 95% confidence interval

## Null Hypothesis testing prior to the study

- In reality, null is true:
  - Study rejects the null
    - Type I error (alpha error)
  - Study fails to reject the null
    - Correct
- In reality, null is false:
  - Study rejects the null
    - Correct
  - Study fails to reject the null
    - Type II error (beta error)
    
## After the study is completed
- Under condition of null hypothesis:
  - Check study findings
  - Interpret what would happen:
    - If the study were to be conducted 100 times
    - p-value
    - substantive significance
  - Point Estimate
  - 95% Confidence Interval
  
## Hands-on Exercise and group discussion with the paper  
 
 ## Sample size estimation
 
 ## Hands-on exercise of sample size estimation
 
 ## Discuss: what happens if you conduct a study with too low sample size or too high sample size?
 
 ## Bias
 
 ## Selection Bias
 
 ## Example of Selection Bias
 
 ## Response Bias
 
 ## Example of Response Bias
 
 ## Measurement Bias
 
 ## Non-differential misclassification bias
 
 ## How should one eliminate bias?
 - Objective measurement
 - Training of surveyors
 - Selection of participants in the study
 - Blinding
   - Single blinding
   - Double blinding
 
## Hands-on exercise with group discussion with a study

## Controlling Confounding

## Concept of confounding
- Must be associated with both exposure and outcome
- Must not come in the causal pathway 
- Conceptual not statistical

## Example of confounding

## Controlling for confounding
- Randomisation
- Matching
- Stratified Analysis
- Multivariable Analysis

## Randomisation procedure
- Using a random numbers table

## Hands-on: Use a random numbers table to allocate participants

## Example of a matched analysis

## Example of a stratified analysis

## Example of multivariable analysis

## Hands-on: Read this study and comment on how did the researchers controlled confounding

## External validity
- Generalisabile to wider population
- Feasibility
- Efficacy versus Effectiveness

## Summary of key points
- Chance bias confounding
- Internal versus external validity
- True association versus false association
