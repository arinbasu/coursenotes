## Introduction to the four courses

In this repository you will find four sets of course notes and readings. Each set of course notes and readings is tagged with the appropriate course code. These are as follows:

- Notes for HLTH214 are tagged *#hlth214*
- Notes for HLTH301 are tagged *#hlth301*
- Notes for HLTH403 are tagged *#hlth403*
- Notes for HLTH460 are tagged *#hlth460*

These notes are also linked to the respective sections of your Learn course folders and sites. Note that some of these are free text narrative notes, others are diagrams and analyses, and yet others are tutorials and slide decks. Some other file formats such as videos and pdfs are posted as well. For all questions and comments on the contents, please write to me at [arindam.basu@canterbury.ac.nz](mailto:arindam.basu@canterbury.ac.nz). 


You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
